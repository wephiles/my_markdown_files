Good morning/afternoon/evening, professors. I am truly honored to be here today for this interview. My name is Bu Weishi, or you can call me Tim. I am 23 years old and hail from Tianshui in Gansu Province. I possess a pleasant personality and enjoy making new friends. 

I major in Computer Science and Technology at Tianjin Normal University. Over the past five years, I have dedicated most of my time to my studies. I consider myself a diligent student, as evidenced by my high grades in subjects, with a particular score of 88 in Data Structures. While grades are not everything, they do reflect the effort and energy I have invested in my education.

In my leisure time, I have a strong interest in playing basketball, reading books, and listening to music.  These hobbies not only help me relax but also recharge my motivation to learn. Python is my favorite programming language, and I often write programs and blog about my experiences to enhance my comprehensive skills.

Additionally, I completed an internship at a company during the recent holiday season. This experience provided me with a deeper understanding of the business world and its operations, giving me an early introduction to the realm of business and management.

Furthermore, my keen interest in my major has solidified my aspiration to pursue a higher degree in Computer Science and Technology at this esteemed university. I believe that studying here will elevate my academic research to new heights.
